# Steam Top 100 Sellers Scraper

This project scrapes the top 100 best-selling games from the Steam store using Scrapy and displays the data through a Flask web application. The scraper extracts essential game details, including names, release dates, prices, platforms, and ratings. Data is stored and passed to Flask in real time using `scrapy-rt`, enabling dynamic updates and display within the Flask web app.
