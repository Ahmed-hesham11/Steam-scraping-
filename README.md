# Steam Top 100 Sellers Scraper

This project scrapes the top 100 best-selling games from the Steam store using Scrapy and displays the data through a Flask web application. The scraper extracts essential game details, including names, release dates, prices, platforms, and ratings. Data is stored and passed to Flask in real time using `scrapy-rt`, enabling dynamic updates and display within the Flask web app.

## How to Install and Run the Project

To get started with this project locally, follow these steps to set up the environment and run the scraper and web application.

### Prerequisites

- Python 
- Scrapy
- Flask
- Werkzeug

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required packages from `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start the Flask Server**  
   Launch the Flask application to view the data:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Run the Scrapy Crawler**  
   In another terminal window, run the Scrapy crawler to start scraping data:
   ```bash
   scrapy crawl steam_spider
   ```

The data collected by Scrapy is stored and passed to Flask in real time using `scrapy-rt`, allowing you to view the latest scraped information on the Flask web app.

## Project Structure

- `items.py` - Defines the data structure for the scraped items, such as `game_name`, `platform`, and `discounted_rate`.
- `middlewares.py` - Configures the Scrapy middleware for spider and downloader operations.
- `pipelines.py` - Processes and cleans up the items before storing them.
- `settings.py` - Contains the Scrapy project settings, including configurations for caching and throttling.

## Usage

1. Open the Flask app on your local server to view the top 100 games.
2. Run the scraper periodically or as needed to refresh the data.

## Configuration

You can adjust the scraping settings in `settings.py`, such as download delay, caching options, and the number of items scraped (limited to 100 in this setup).
